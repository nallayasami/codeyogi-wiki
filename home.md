# Welcome to Nallai.dev 🌿

Hey there! 👋  

Welcome to **Nallai.dev** — my cozy digital space to **learn, build, and grow** every day, one small step at a time. 🚀

## What This Is

This site is my personal log of **learning, sharing, and reflecting** — a way to grow while helping others do the same.

- 💻 Programming & Projects  
- 📚 Books & Learning Notes  
- 🧘 Mindset & Lifestyle  
- 🛠️ Tools & Experiments  

## Why I Do This

Writing helps me **learn better**, **share more**, and **stay curious**.  
If something here sparks an idea or helps you grow, that’s mission accomplished. 🌱
